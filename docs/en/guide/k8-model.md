# K8 Model

## Overview

The **K8** (Human Skills) model defines 8 professional archetypes based on soft skills. The archetypes are universal competency profiles, independent of the job role, that represent distinctive combinations of soft skills.

**Current version:** v2.0 (February 2026)

## Founding Principles

### 1. Universality of archetypes

Each archetype represents a competency profile valid for any person, regardless of current role, age or professional situation. A student, an unemployed person, an employee or an executive can all identify with a specific archetype based on their soft skills.

### 2. Separation between archetypes and roles

Archetypes **do not derive** from roles but are theoretically defined as combinations of soft skills. Roles are associated with archetypes only secondarily, to populate landing pages with relevant job offers.

### 3. Role of the survey

The user's archetype emerges from answers about competencies and attitudes, not from declaring a job role. This is consistent with the Beyond Titles message of going beyond one's professional title.

## Indicative Soft Skills

For each archetype, a core of **4-5 indicative soft skills** has been identified using a theoretical-conceptual approach. Selection criteria:

1. **Conceptual coherence** between the skills
2. **Distinctiveness** compared to other archetypes
3. **Representativeness** in the database

## Affinity Calculation

The affinity between a role and an archetype is calculated by counting how many of the archetype's indicative soft skills are present in the role's profile.

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Minimum threshold | **≥ 2 soft skills** in common |
| Multiple affinity | A role can be affine to multiple archetypes |
| Metric | Shared skills count / total indicative skills |

**Example:** The Sales Engineer has a 5/5 affinity with The Connector (possesses all 5 indicative skills). The Inbound Call Centre Agent has a 3/5 affinity.

## Confirmation Percentage

For each archetype, the **confirmation percentage** indicates how many of the affine roles actually possess each indicative soft skill.

**Example:** If The Connector has 135 affine roles and 110 possess "Communication", the confirmation for Communication = 110/135 = **81%**.

## Detailed Profiles

### The Connector

> *Builds bridges between people*

Excels in interpersonal relationships and communication. Knows how to actively listen, engage interlocutors and put the customer at the centre. Is the reference point for creating authentic and lasting connections.

| Soft Skill | Confirmation |
|---|---|

| Listening | 96/135 — **71%** |
| Customer Orientation | 82/135 — **61%** |
| Engagement | 67/135 — **50%** |
| Standing | 55/135 — **41%** |

**Rationale:** Communication and Listening form the core (complementary skills for effective dialogue). Customer Orientation extends relational capacity outward. Engagement = ability to activate and motivate interlocutors. Standing adds presence and authority.

**Main professional areas:** B2B Sales and agents (238 off.), Retail and luxury sales (134 off.), GDO and supermarkets (128 off.)

::: warning Archetype with few offers
With only 232 associated offers, The Pioneer is among the archetypes with the lowest coverage in the database. This reflects the database composition, not a model defect.

**Main professional areas:** Mechanics and CNC (35 off.), Quality and control (19 off.), Textile and fashion (18 off.)

::: warning Archetype with few offers
With only 166 associated offers across 34 roles, The Craftsman has the lowest coverage. It could benefit from landing page aggregation with The Pragmatist.

## Shared Skills Between Archetypes

Some soft skills appear in multiple archetypes, creating overlap zones:

| Soft Skill | Archetypes |
|---|---|
| Thoroughness | The Pragmatist, The Collaborator, The Craftsman |
| Planning & Organisation | The Strategist, The Pragmatist |
| Flexibility / Alternative Thinking | The Collaborator, The Pioneer |
| Initiative | The Pioneer, The Captain |
| Concreteness | The Pragmatist, The Resolver |

## Critical Points

### Offer Balancing

The distribution of offers between archetypes is very uneven:

| Archetype | Offers | Roles |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| The Collaborator | **1,137** | 160 |
| The Resolver | 973 | 148 |
| The Connector | 891 | 135 |
| The Strategist | 831 | 169 |
| The Pragmatist | 814 | 148 |
| The Captain | 365 | 54 |
| The Pioneer | 232 | 40 |
| The Craftsman | **166** | 34 |

This reflects the database and job market composition, not a model defect. It is recommended to monitor the UX for archetypes with few offers.

### Landing Page Aggregation Strategy

For archetypes with few offers, it is suggested to aggregate landing pages while keeping archetypes separate in the survey:

- **The Resolver + The Strategist** — shared analytical and problem-solving skills
- **The Craftsman + The Pragmatist** — shared precision and execution skills

## Model Evolution

| Version | Date | Roles with SS | Offers | News |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| v1.1 | Jan 2026 | 379 | 2,460 | Base model |
| **v2.0** | Feb 2026 | **453** | **2,671** | Soft skill inheritance system |

The increase of +74 roles and +211 offers in v2.0 was achieved thanks to the inheritance system developed in collaboration with Andrea De Vecchi of Gi Group (see [Data Pipeline](./data-pipeline)).
